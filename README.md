# DiscordMonsterHunter
Discord server based monster hunting RPG


Discord Monster Hunter is a command bot designed to be run in a discord server that allows for the creation of heroes, with individual classes, to combat elevating tiers of monsters. DMH Bot offers items, equipment, a leveling system, class abilities, and endless fun. 

I built this Bot to practice various aspects of Python while I studied the language. DMG Bot is currently operational in this discord server:
